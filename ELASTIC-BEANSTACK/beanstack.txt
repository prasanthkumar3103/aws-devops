Beanstack:
-----------
1.hosting platform for different application(java,python,php,dotnet)
2.this is for purely dev job
3.you should have python  in machine(local)

4.aws configure(give credentials of IAM user/role with access to elastic beanstack)
5.install awsebcli (pip install awsebcli)
6.navigate to some directory
7.from cmdline use eb init(select docker as a platform)
8.copy dockerfile into this directory
9.execute eb create(this will create environment in application)
10.if u want new changes make changes to dockerfile in current directory and execute
eb deploy

for each eb deploy, it creates everytime new version.

installing docker/packages what application need it create implicitly
also,security groups,
internally it creates ec2 machines.

it easy to wipe out environments,like for each release wise.


write all these steps in jenkins file and it start does everything.

developer would be uploading zip code or war file.


q.will we be able to change ec2/software/load balancing etc during creation?
yes


lambda charges less than this beanstic?

beanstack is free,but what ever creates to make app run(ec2,db etc, it charges for them)',usage beanstack doesnt charge.
