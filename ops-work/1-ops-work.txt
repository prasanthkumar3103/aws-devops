opswork:
--------
1. this is an aws service to create to infrastructure in aws.
2. it uses of chef for some of it activities

how is ops works different from cloudformation or elasticbeanstack?
sol:

elasticbeanstack: closer to dev(building dot net orjava or nodejs or php appl)
cloudformation :closer aws service,speaks to aws infrastructure

ops works : closer to admin world/configuration management tool

Notes:-
--------
1. we create stack in opswork,each stack contains layer

elb is one layer,application is one layer and db is one layer

how many layers we can create?
it depends on our application.

2. we would have stack for deployments(SIT,QA,PTE,STAGING AND PROD STACKS)

3. WE Will have 2 repo's , one for cookbook and 2 is for app repository.


Layer life cycle:- every layer will have eventing,during this events we can call recipes else manual execution.

events

set up: when ec2 is set up/booted ( here we can chef receipes)
configure: whenever there is change in instance(like when instance online or leave state)
deploy:for deploy app
undeploy:for undeploy app
shutdown: when to shutdown layer(ec2)


ops work provides three solutions to configure ur infrastructure

1.creating stack
================

1.opswork stack: (choose this.)
2.opswork for chef automate
3.opswork for puppet automate


whenever u choose ops work its has to be either linux or windows, not both

once u have choose ops work based on organization chef version(11,12),choose appropriate one

name stackname,region,vpc,subnet,os,chef version
Use custom Chef cookbooks :yes
repo type: git,s3 archive,http.svn
repo url:https://github.com/prasanthkumar3103/ChefZone_Batch1/blob/master/demo/cookbooks/webapp-linux/recipes/default.rb


advanced options:
	default root device tyep: EBS backed(choose), instance store
	IAM role

add stack


2.creating layer
================

name:
	create

go to setting
		instance shutdown time:120
