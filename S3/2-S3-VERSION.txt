1.i have one.txt file
2.i have enabled versioning 
3.i have uploaded 2 versions of one.txt,after that i found out that i dont need versioniong and i have disabled versioning.
  now that doesnt mean that one.txt will have one version,that means that from there on whatever the upload u want to do it will have one version.
  but ur earlier versions will not be deleted.
