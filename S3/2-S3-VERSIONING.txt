1.i have one.txt file
2.i have enabled versioning 
3.i have uploaded 2 versions of one.txt,after that i found out that i dont need versioniong and i have disabled versioning.
  now that doesnt mean that one.txt will have one version,that means that from there on whatever the upload u want to do it will have one version.
  but ur earlier versions will not be deleted.
older versions deletion that u have to do ,aws doesnt delete default.

meaning once versioning enabled & uploaded, it cant be delted ,only can be disabled.


once one.txt upload ,enable versioning and upload same file multiple times and choose different storage class.

q. can we have different storage class for same file with different version?
sol:yes
everytime u have to choose the storage class.


notes: versioning options  enable/suspend.
